                <h2>What is web design?</h2>
                <p>
                    Web design is the art of creating content for the internet. In this Coder Dojo course you will
                    create your own personal web site that you can upload to the internet and show off to all your friends.
                    To create a web site you will need to know both <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>.
                    <abbr title="Hypertext markup language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr
                        title="cascading style sheets">CSS</abbr> are the language of the <strong>World Wide
                    Web</strong> and browsers, such as <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/chrome/" target="_blank">Google
                    Chrome</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/safari/" target="_blank">Safari</a>, <a
                        href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> and <a
                        href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie" target="_blank">Internet
                    Explorer</a> read it to display the pages you see when you surf the web.
                </p>

                <a name="html-css"></a>
                <h2>What is HTML and CSS?</h2>
                <p>
                    When creating a web site we will primarily need to focus on just two things.
                </p>
                <ol style="list-style: none;">
                    <li><span style="display: inline-block; min-width: 30px;">&#9312;</span><strong style="display: inline-block; min-width: 55px;">Content</strong> &nbsp; &rarr; &nbsp; What the page says</li>
                    <li><span style="display: inline-block; min-width: 30px;">&#9313;</span><strong style="display: inline-block; min-width: 55px;">Style</strong> &nbsp; &rarr; &nbsp; How the page looks</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Now imagine your favourite web site. It no doubt contains blocks of text, images and data.
                    This <i>information</i> is considered to be the &#9312;&nbsp;<strong>content</strong> of the page.
                    Some of this content may appear to have different colours, sizes and fonts.
                    These <i>visual enhancements</i> of the content is the &#9313;&nbsp;<strong>style</strong> of the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we can understand the difference between content and style we an divide these concepts into 2
                    separate files, one for content and one for style.
                </p>

                <a name="html-file"></a>
                <h3>&#9312; &nbsp; HTML file</h3>
                <p>
                    The first file we shall create is the <abbr title="Hypertext markup language">HTML</abbr> file
                    and this is where we shall type all of our content.
                    Let&rsquo;s assume we want to build a web site about our favourite games. We will then need to create
                    several HTML web page files. Each page will have a title, a description, some screen shots, lists or tables
                    of scores and possibly an embedded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a> video.
                </p>

                <a name="css-file"></a>
                <h3>&#9313; &nbsp; CSS file</h3>
                <p>
                    Without applying any style the HTML content would be rather boring black text on a white background.
                    But no-one wants to see that. So we&rsquo;ll create a CSS <strong>stylesheet</strong> file and use that to assign
                    text sizes, fonts, colors and alignments to the various content <strong>tag</strong> elements.
                </p>

                <div class="tip">
                    <h3>Tip</h3>
                    <p class="center"><span style="display: inline-block; min-width: 80px; text-align: right;"><strong>Content</strong></span> &nbsp; &#9312; &nbsp; &rarr; &nbsp; <span style="display: inline-block; min-width: 80px; text-align: left;"><strong>HTML file</strong></span></p>
                    <p class="center"><span style="display: inline-block; min-width: 80px; text-align: right;"><strong>Style</strong></span>   &nbsp; &#9313; &nbsp; &rarr; &nbsp; <span style="display: inline-block; min-width: 80px; text-align: left;"><strong>CSS file</strong></span></p>
                </div>


                <!--p>
                    When building a web page you will initially need to create 2 files. Firstly you will need to create a HTML
                    file as this will contain all the text and data content of the page. If you are going
                    to create a web page about your favourite food, then you would probably want to have some paragraphs
                    describing the food, a list of the ingredients, some photographs and perhaps a <a
                        href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube</a> video of how you made it. All of this
                    information will need to be added to your HTML file using <strong>tags</strong> to structure it in a
                    way that a browser can understand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you have all the information saved in your HTML file you can open and read it in your web
                    browser. At this point it will just be black text on a white background. But that doesn't look very
                    pretty. To personalise your web page with <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colornames.asp"
                                                                 target="_blank">colours</a> and <a
                        href="http://www.google.com/fonts" target="_blank">fonts</a> you will need to add a CSS <strong>stylesheet</strong>.
                    You will then need to create a single CSS file and link that to all your HTML web pages so that your
                    entire web site has a consistent theme.
                </p>

                <div id="theme-selector">
                    <a class="select-spongebob" href="javascript::">Spongebob</a>
                    <a class="select-gaming" href="javascript::">Gaming</a>
                    <a class="select-coder-dojo" href="javascript::">Coder Dojo</a>
                </div>

                <p>
                    So how does the CSS file influence a web page? Can I change how this page looks by editing its CSS
                    file? Try clicking on the buttons above. Doing so will change the CSS file connected to this web
                    page. As you can see the formatting and layout of a web page is defined by its CSS file.
                </p>

                    To begin creating your own web pages, lets jump to the <a class="show-page-2" href="javascript::">next
                    section...</a>
                </p-->
            </section>
            <div class="nav">
                <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/page_2.html" class="next-page">Let&rsquo;s get started &#187;</a>
            </div>
        </article>
    </div>
</div>
{% include footer.html %}
</body>
